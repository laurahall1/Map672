This should be interesting!
## My Learning Objectives
* To become more proficient at technology troubleshooting
* To become somewhat conversant with coding jargon
* To learn JavaScript, of course
* To truly understand how the code makes a Web map
* Following up on the above, I'd like to be able to think through a mapping problem and write the code to fix it, rather than merely following directions in hopes of achieving a desired outcome. I felt like most of my work in 671 was doing the latter.
