<p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>I had two immediate reactions when reading this manifesto. First, I think I've found the David Foster Wallaces of the mapping world. Second, when reading the part of the paper about the inacurracy maps may have in representing the physical world, I thought of The West Wing episode in which a group of cartographers spoke of how the U.S. (perhaps it was all of North America) was actually much smaller than depicted on many maps. I'm very glad reference was made to it in this paper.</p>
    <p> In the coder/cartographer/critic camps, I guess by default I am a critic. Having limited technology skills, I cannot be considered a coder (though I hope to become more adept throughout the semester, of course), and I am suspicious of those who want to do something just because it can be done, without considering the necessity of the action. I greatly admire the cartographers, but I do not have the artist's eye and the design skills to make a beautiful map. (Again, this is an area in which I'd like to grow.) I am a crtiic, but so is everyone else. I believe that a lot of thought needs to be put into why a map is being made in the first place. Is it a map to be used for navigation or illustration? If it's the former, I'm willing to sacrifice aesthetics for precision and accuracy. The most beautiful road atlas is useless if it does not correctly lay out and label the arteries of a city. If a map is illustrative (and this is the term I use for the sort of maps that tell me the incidences of cancer in counties across the United States; I'm sure there is a better term for these sort of maps), I want it to be accurate, of course, but I also want a good reason to use a map to discover this sort of data. Why a map, say, rather than a set of tables? Does it provide layers of information in an easily accessible way? Is it an attractive presentation?</p>
    <p>My goal in map making is to produce engaging maps, maps pretty enough to delight a cartographer, tricked out enough to satisfy a coder, and compelling enough to placate a critic. I want to make a map that will be of use to someone, somewhere. Open source mapping software that is relatively easy to use (though it takes some skill to master, I think) has enabled citizen mappers. While all maps "lie," the more maps created by people across the world, from all sorts of backgrounds, may allow us to find a truth in information, even if it may never be "the" truth.</p>
